Hello people!

I'm Johnny, trying to become a web developer, to have better flexibility on when and where I work! I will be sacrificing my current lucrative career in order to be closer to my family. I enjoy VBA programming in my current role, and I always liked design classes back in high school, so hopefully web development will be a good fit for me!
